Simply removes the ads from displaying.

# Other news

I will be maintaining this mod and another called MoreAds to give people control over how they want their ad experience to go.
No promises for custom ads, but I would love if those could be added to the mix.
This will likely always be a standalone client side only mod, so if you want more controls than just refusing to display the ad for the client, this isn't the mod for you.

# Troubleshooting

If this mod doesn't remove the ad for you, please reach out, preferrably with a log, so I can take a look at why it failed.
You can reach me on [GitHub](https://github.com/cdusold/lethal-removeads) and on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1168655651455639582/1379569936703160340).
