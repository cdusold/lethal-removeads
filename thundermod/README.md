Simply removes the ads by telling the game engine that one's already played this week.
If Zeekerss adds the ability for the game to play more than one ad per quota, I'll have to revisit this.

## Coming soon

A version of this that sets the "already played" bool to false instead after each ad is in the works for people who want more ads.
This will be useful once the ability to swap out ads (possibly to annoy your friends) like we do with the paintings, pictures, and TV videos now.
